tips:
  - "&cTip: &fBypass your inventory to get items and tools faster."
  - "&cTip: &fMake your crosshair a step ahead of the enemy to anticipate their movements."
  - "&cTip: &fThe only way to win a fight is to not lose. Practice your movement."
  - "&cTip: &fYour inventory can be your worst enemy. Make sure you know what's in there."
  - "&cTip: &fKnow your combos, it's the only way to get better."
  - "&cTip: &fLearn to 'strafe' to dodge your opponents' attacks. Moving from side to side is key."
  - "&cTip: &f'Sprint-resetting' is your best friend to maintain speed while attacking and defending."
  - "&cTip: &fA 'combo' isn't just about hitting fast, it's about maintaining rhythm and distance to give your enemy no break."
  - "&cTip: &f'Hitboxes' are bigger than you think. Aim for the feet to break the enemy's combo and attack them again."
  - "&cTip: &fUse blocks to your advantage. Place one to create distance or to cover yourself from an unexpected hit."
  - "&cTip: &fThe 'rod' or fishing rod can help you keep your opponent at bay or start a combo."
  - "&cTip: &f'Bow-spamming' is not a crime. If your enemy is running away, an arrow can be the difference between a victory and a defeat."
  - "&cTip: &fThe 'block-hit' is an advanced technique. It not only reduces damage but can also help you start your own combo."
  - "&cTip: &fIf you run out of food, the 'Golden Apple' can save you, but don't overuse it."
  - "&cTip: &fUse 'shift-tapping' for greater precision in your combos. Moving slowly can be more effective than running."
  - "&cTip: &fKeep your 'Ping' low. If your internet is slow, no matter how good you are, the lag will make you lose."
  - "&cTip: &fDon't give up. Every lost fight is an opportunity to learn something new and get better."
  - "&cTip: &fThe '50/50 rule' is that you should always be ready for defense and for attack."
  - "&cTip: &fIf you are 'strafed', use 'W-tap' to readjust your position and continue attacking."
  - "&cTip: &fNot all 'kits' are the same. Some are better for ranged combat and others for melee."
  - "&cTip: &fPractice on servers with different maps. Not all maps are the same and learning to adapt is a great skill."
  - "&cTip: &fDon't use the 'slowness potion'. It's very useful for a 'combo', but if you don't use it well it can be your downfall."
  - "&cTip: &fThe 'crit-hit' or critical hit is not a myth. If you jump and attack at the same time, you'll do more damage."
  - "&cTip: &fKnow your limits. Don't get into a fight if you know you're going to lose. Sometimes it's better to retreat to fight another day."
  - "&cTip: &fThe 'crosshair' is your best friend. If it's in the exact spot, there's no way you'll miss a hit."
